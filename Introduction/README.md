Mini series on #golang (Intro)

:blue_heart:#1 - The love affair!

——————————————————

Imagine a farm with smart tractors powered by #AI, navigating autonomously and collecting sensor data. They pre-process the data on the edge and publish this data every 100ms and users access the KPIs via an app.
Toolchains for the above scenario include: system-level languages (C/C++, #java), a solid middleware (#ROS or #DDS), cloud (IoT, databases), and modern app frameworks.
Compiled code written using a system-level language is hugely optimised.
From a design perspective, you’ll also find that breaking complexity through object abstraction and polymorphism are powerful ideas to put your mind towards. But, all love stories go through a rough patch...

:parrot:#2 - We need to talk moment!

C/C++ has been great for system developers... used in #gaming, #GUI, #robotics, browsers, embedded systems, and AR/VR. :video_game:
So yes, it is relevant; and it's not going away soon! However, all this optimisation and speed benefit comes at a cost, e.g., linking and dependency hell; the slow compilation etc.

:face_with_diagonal_mouth:#3 - System-level? Meh!

——————————————————

The democratisation of knowledge and open source combined with rapid prototyping & deployment has given rise to a host of developer assistant tools and frameworks. This has made it ever so easier for developers to get their bytes in order and roll their apps out in production in record times!
However, performance may drop, for example, with real-time image processing and IoT device data logging on the edge.

:information_desk_person::skin-tone-4:#4 - In comes the saviour!

——————————————————

The greats at Google came up with a relatively simple standard library that acts as a bridge between low-level system programs and higher-level apps:mobile_phone:So say hi to #Go.
It offers high performance/concurrency whilst still preserving your sanity! :right_anger_bubble:
It's lightweight, yet incredibly powerful and used to create #kubernetes #dropbox and #docker.:zap:️:muscle::skin-tone-3:
