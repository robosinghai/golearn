Mini series on #golang (Basics - Part 1)

:performing_arts:#1 - Compiled for better performance!

——————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Golang comes packed with a huge number of features that makes it easy for developers to write code that needs performance.
Go is compiled (faster) and runs without dependencies at run-time!
In case you wondering: compilation is the process of translating human readable source code to machine code (assembly in the case of Go) or an intermediary language in Java or C#.

:parrot:#2 - GO infers type automatically!

———————————————————————————————————————————

Static Typing - Static typing means that variables are of a specific type, e.g., int, string, float, etc. In some cases, the compiler automatically figures out the type (as in my example above). Huge advantages when you combine static typing with compiling, e.g., executable size and mem management, etc.

🗑️:#3 - Garbage Collection!

——————————————————————————————————————

Think of it as a process where a variable's life can be easily defined, e.g., using the scope operator, i.e., the variable disappears when the function exits. Typically, in C one would use a free() function to clear out the trash. GO is great at Garbage collection as it handles this automatically for you
